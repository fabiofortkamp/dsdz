# Notes from "Data Science from Scratch"

These are notes from the PT-BR edition "Data Science do Zero", by Joel Grus (Rio de Janeiro: Alta Books, 2016). The original repository is [here](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch).

I've copied some examples from the book, with some comments of my own, and 
added type annotations.
